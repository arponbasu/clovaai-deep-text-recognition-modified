1. Clone this repository and type "bash run.sh" in your pwd to execute the code.
2. A few important points:

(i) Even though there are provisions for prevent the re-execution of the image generation code in case the necessary directory is already present, I advise you not to use it as sometimes that leads to images and their labels being mangled, leading to haywire training.

(ii) You need to add a .pth file in the default_model folder (or if you add it in any other location, you have to give the suitable path when the command prompt asks you too)
